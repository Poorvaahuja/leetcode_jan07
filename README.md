## Q1 Arithmetic Slices II - subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.
For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.
## Q2 Find missing and repeating
Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
smallest positive missing number is 2.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findTwoElement() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an array of integers of size 2 denoting the answer ( The first index contains B and second index contains A.)
